"""Regression test: keep bytecode out of the deployed skill, from entry points.

When book-to-skill is installed as an agent skill, the skill *is* the source
tree — it is cloned or unpacked into `~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/` (or
another host root) and executed from there. Any `__pycache__` written on first
run ends up shipped inside the skill: extra files to scan, noise in diffs, and
`__pycache__/*.pyc` showing up wherever the skill is published or shared.

The agent invoking the skill does not set PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE, so the guard
has to live in the entry points themselves, before the package is imported.

The guard does NOT belong at import time in a library module: a host process
that merely does `import book_to_skill` must not have its global
`sys.dont_write_bytecode` flipped underneath it. `if __name__ == "__main__":`
is false for such an import, which is why the policy is wrapped in it.

Two failure modes this test must reject, both fixed here:
  * a subprocess that crashes before doing anything — the old test discarded
    the return code, so an entry point that immediately raised
    `SystemExit(1)` still reported "1 passed";
  * a vacuous pass from an empty output — every run now asserts the tool
    actually produced its documented banner/usage line.

Bytecode is measured in an isolated deployment copy, never by deleting files
from the developer's working tree.
